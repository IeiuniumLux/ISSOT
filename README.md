# ISSOT
The ISS Orbit Tracker (ISSOT) is an Android Things project that keeps track of the International Space Station. It calculates and displays the azimuth and elevation during the ISS pass. This relatively simple device will give you a visual indication of the location of the space station, even if you can't see it.
